                <h3>Academic Achievements</h3>
                <p>In high school, I was able to go through the Diploma Program and earn my International Baccalaureate Diploma as I attended an IB school. This is an extremely rigorous and academically challenging program that is taught on an international scale, allowing students to work independently and manage their rigorous course schedule. During these years, I was able to juggle a variety of extracurriculars, including varsity volleyball and academic organizations such as HOSA. Additionally, I am a candidate for a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies with a focus on International Business, currently earning a GPA of 3.6 at a top-ranked national and international university.</p>

                <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
                <p>I have worked in a variety of jobs to gain experience in the general workforce, taking away lessons and developing skills that will further help me in my future career. For example, due to my experience as a bookkeeper at AutoSplash Car Wash, as well as my roles as a math and reading tutor and a coding/computer tutor, I have learned to manage and organize large quantities of documents, files, and reports. I have experience keeping extensive records on an individual level for hundreds of different students, thanks to my work at Kumon Math & Reading Center, and have had to maintain a general memory of these records to apply them to the specific student I happen to be teaching. I also possess excellent multitasking skills. In both my tutoring/instructional jobs, I have had to manage, be present for, and teach multiple children simultaneously. Additionally, my experience as a retail store employee required me to complete a variety of tasks simultaneously, such as customer service and store maintenance.</p>

                <h3>Language and Tehnical Skills</h3>
                <p>Growing up Pakistani-American, I am fully verbally fluent in both English and Urdu/Hindi. Additionally, having taken Spanish for 7 years during middle and high school, as well as having had to take an IB Exam on Spanish in order to earn my diploma, I consider myself intermediate in Spanish. Finally, due to my major being International Studies with a focus on International Business, I was required to complete four quarters in a language learning course, for which I chose French and also consider myself intermediate. In addition to my language skills, I have also fine-tuned my technical skills, being proficient in all programs of Google Docs and Microsoft (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.). I have also recently taken up a computing course at my university, allowing me to say I have basic skills and understanding in coding.</p>
